# Recland HTML/CSS

Welcome to Recland HTML/CSS project!

## Overview
This project is aimed at enhancing SCSS skills by replicating a template sourced from a Figma file. The primary focus is on translating intricate design elements into clean HTML and CSS code. While prioritizing meticulous design fidelity, mobile responsiveness isn't the current focus.
